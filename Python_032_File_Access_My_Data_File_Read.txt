And in the streets, the children screamed.
The lovers cried, and the poets dreamed.
But not a word was spoken.
The church bells all were broken.
And the three men I admire most:
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost.
They caught the last train for the coast.
The day the music died ...
And they were singing: 
Bye-bye, Miss American Pie.
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry.
Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye.
Singing, "This'll be the day that I die!"
This will be the day that I die.
